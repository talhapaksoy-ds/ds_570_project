# House Sale Price Prediction & Affordability Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science application developed for the DS570 Final Project. It analyzes Turkish house sale listings, builds a predictive machine learning model for sale price estimation, and presents the results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The project focuses on two connected questions:

1. Can house sale prices be predicted from listing-level property features such as city, district, neighborhood, area and room layout?
2. Can the model output be used to support a simple housing affordability analysis?

The project is designed as a reproducible data science application rather than a static notebook. It includes data processing, exploratory visualization, predictive modeling, model evaluation, an interactive dashboard, Git-based project organization and Docker containerization.

## Problem Statement

Housing prices are highly dependent on location and physical property characteristics. However, buyers often need more than raw listing prices. They need to understand whether a listed price is reasonable relative to similar listings and whether it is affordable under a chosen income scenario.

This project develops a dashboard that allows users to:

- Explore housing price patterns across cities, districts and neighborhoods.
- Compare sale prices by area and room layout.
- Predict the expected sale price of a property.
- Compare predicted prices with district-level medians.
- Evaluate affordability using a simple income-based purchase budget rule.

## Data Source

This project uses the **Real Estate Prices in Turkey 2025** dataset published on Kaggle by Emre Karadağ. The dataset is described as a Turkey housing prices dataset and contains real estate listing information that can be used to analyze the Turkish housing market and build predictive models for property prices.

The original dataset page is available on Kaggle under the title **Real Estate Prices in Turkey 2025**. The dataset was selected because it provides property-level listing information from Turkey and is more relevant to the project objective than generic benchmark datasets such as Iris, MNIST or Titanic. 

For this project, the raw dataset was processed into a cleaned CSV file used by the dashboard and modeling pipeline:

```text
data/processed/house_sales_cleaned_for_ds570.csv

The project uses a processed Turkish house sale listings dataset.

Expected file location:

```text
data/processed/house_sales_cleaned_for_ds570.csv
```

The dataset contains the following main fields:

```text
seller_type
area_m2
room_layout
city
district
neighborhood
listing_date
price_try
```

Additional engineered fields are created during preprocessing:

```text
rooms
living_rooms
total_rooms
listing_month
listing_day
price_per_m2
```

The dataset is based on sale listings rather than completed transaction prices. Therefore, the target variable represents asking price rather than confirmed market transaction price.

---

## Target Variable

The machine learning target is:

```text
price_try
```

This represents the listed sale price in Turkish Lira.

---

## Methodology

The project follows a standard end-to-end data science workflow:

1. Data audit
2. Data cleaning
3. Feature engineering
4. Baseline model development
5. Machine learning model training
6. Model evaluation
7. Dashboard development
8. Docker containerization

---

## Data Processing

The preprocessing step performs the following operations:

- Standardizes column names.
- Parses room layout values such as `3+1` into numeric room variables.
- Converts listing dates into usable date fields.
- Creates `listing_month` and `listing_day` features.
- Calculates `price_per_m2` for exploratory analysis.
- Applies domain-based filtering to remove unrealistic property records.

Domain-based model candidate filters:

```text
20 <= area_m2 <= 500
500,000 <= price_try <= 50,000,000
room layout must be parseable
```

The project intentionally excludes `price_per_m2` from model inputs because it is calculated from the target variable and would create data leakage.

---

## Feature Engineering

The model uses the following input features:

```text
seller_type
room_layout
city
district
neighborhood
area_m2
rooms
living_rooms
total_rooms
listing_month
listing_day
```

Categorical features are encoded inside a scikit-learn pipeline. Numerical features are passed through the modeling pipeline without applying target-derived transformations.

---

## Models

Two models are used:

### Baseline Model

```text
City + district median price predictor
```

This baseline predicts the median training price for each city and district combination. It is a meaningful benchmark because location is one of the strongest determinants of housing prices.

### Machine Learning Model

```text
RandomForestRegressor with log-transformed target
```

The target is log-transformed during training to reduce the effect of the right-skewed housing price distribution.

---

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using regression metrics:

```text
MAE
RMSE
R²
MAPE
```

Current model results:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² | MAPE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| City + district median baseline | 1,343,255 TRY | 2,417,259 TRY | 0.2868 | 39.52% |
| Random Forest with log target | 949,546 TRY | 1,968,067 TRY | 0.5272 | 25.37% |

The Random Forest model reduces MAE by approximately 29.31% compared with the baseline.

## Dashboard Features

The Streamlit dashboard includes six main sections:

### 1. Overview

- Filtered listing count
- Median sale price
- Median price per square meter
- Median area
- District-level price comparison
- Sale price distribution

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

- Area vs sale price relationship
- Median price by room layout
- Monthly median price trend

### 3. Prediction Tool

Users can enter property characteristics and receive:

- Predicted sale price
- Predicted price per square meter
- District median comparison
- Affordability ratio

### 4. Model Performance

- Baseline vs ML model metrics
- Feature importance
- Actual vs predicted plot
- Residual distribution

### 5. Affordability Analysis

Users can enter annual household income and an affordability multiplier. The dashboard compares district median prices with the estimated affordable purchase budget.

### 6. Limitations

The dashboard explicitly describes data and modeling limitations.

## How to Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

If the model file is missing, the dashboard automatically runs the training script and generates the required artifacts.

---

## How to Run with Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t ds570-house-price-dashboard .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 ds570-house-price-dashboard
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

The container automatically checks for processed data and model artifacts. If the trained model is not available, it runs the training pipeline before starting the dashboard.

---

## Generated Artifacts

The following files are generated by the model training pipeline and are not required to be stored in Git:

```text
models/house_price_model.joblib
reports/metrics.json
reports/feature_importance.csv
reports/test_predictions.csv
```

Large model artifacts are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

---

## Reproducibility

The project is reproducible because:

- The code is organized into reusable modules.
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- The model can be regenerated from the processed dataset.
- Docker builds the application environment from scratch.
- The dashboard can run without manually adding the trained model artifact.

---

## Limitations

- The dataset contains asking prices, not finalized transaction prices.
- The model does not currently include building age, floor level, heating type, elevator, parking or transportation proximity.
- The affordability analysis is a simplified scenario tool and does not include mortgage rates, down payments or household debt.
- The model is trained on national data and then filtered for Istanbul-oriented analysis, because the Istanbul subset alone is relatively small.
- The current model does not estimate uncertainty intervals.

---

## Future Work

Possible extensions include:

- Adding mortgage payment simulation.
- Adding interest rate and down payment assumptions.
- Incorporating neighborhood-level socioeconomic indicators.
- Adding geocoded map visualizations.
- Comparing Random Forest with gradient boosting models.
- Adding prediction intervals or quantile regression.
- Improving temporal modeling with more historical listing data.
